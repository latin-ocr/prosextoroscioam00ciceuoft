§ 46. certo, ‘ known as such.'

qui animus patrius. Erucius might have known a father’s
feelings in his own person, and to appeal to him as a father
would have been Oicero’s most obvious course. But the hit
‘at his parentage serves Cicero as an excuse for the allusion to
the comedy. [Qui animus . . . esset, after posses.- note the

[humanitatis3 often nearly = doctrina, in the sense of ‘high
culture ;' but here in contrast to doctrinae, ε·- ⁴ human feelingss]

non parum = satis .- cp. ἓ 49, parum miseriae.

studium doctrinae, ⁴ taste for learning! Cicero allows this
to his opponent, because he is about to allude to a fabula.

caecilianus. Caecilius Statius was a famous comio poet
(floruit no. 168 ?), placed by some crItics above Plautus himself:
cp. Volcatius Sedigitus, ap. Gellius, N. A. xv. 24, Caecilio
palmam Statio do mimico: Plautus secundus facile eaesuperat
ceteros. The play here alluded to was an adaptation of
Menander's Ὕποβολιμαῖος (Subditivus) ἢ Ἀγροΐκος. Probably

Eutychus from Εὔτυχος, a rare form of Εὔτυχής. Plautus

tribules. ‘ The Romans did not say contribules, concives
(συμπολῖται), for men of the same tribe or city, but tribules, cives.

P. 1¹7. homines notos, ⁶ men personally known <to myself
