1 l 6 NOTES.

Erucius. Here there is a great lacuna in the MSS„ in which
only a few unconnected words are preserved. From the follow-
ing words of the Scholiast, a fairly safe conjecture may be made
as to the contents: hoc enim dicebat Chrysoqonus: ‘non quia
timui ne mihi tollerentur bona Roscii, ideo eius praedia dissipavi,
scd quia aedificabam, in Veientanam ideo de his transtuli ,· ’ viz„
that here Cicero discussed the question opened in ξ 127, omnino
haec bona non veniisse, i.e. whether the sale of the property had
ever really taken place. [If Cicero could show that it had not.
he would deprive his opponente of even that vestige of a legal
footing] The words of the Scholiast go to show that Cicero
had inferred that there had been no sale, from the dissipatio of
the property [since property legally come by would not be
squandered in such nervous haste]⁸ Cicero seems then to have
passedto a description of Chrysogonus' wealth and arrogance,
the opening words of which are given by the Scholiast, hic eqo
audire istos cupio ,- on which he remarks, in hoc capite de potentia
c'hrysoqoni invidiam facit, ut enumeret sinqula deliciarum ρεπεν-οι,
quod habeat plures possessiones, mancipia, quae omnia dicit de
rapinis ipsum habere.

c. var. aptam: Lambinus supplies hi domum aptam, &c.;
apparently the end of a comparison between the requirements of
Chrysogonus and those of Sulla’s more modest freedmen.

pro Sest. 89, ecce tibi consul, praetor, tribunus pl. nova novi
yeneris edicta proponunt.

de Palatio, from the Palatine hill, on which many Roman
nobles had mansions. From the time of Augustus the Palatino
was the site of the imperial residence, whence the derivation of
‘ palace ' ( palatium).

animi eausa=‘for his own enjoyment :' cp. ξ 134, animi et
aurium causa.

domus referta3 the nom. is put graphically [cp. Virg. Georg.
11. 133, 4]‚ as though ei est (sunt) and not habet had preceded:
fficiriedgg links the two constructions, suiting either. Op. pro

corinthiis et Deliacis, of Corinthian and Delian ore: see
Verr. 1v. 1, Halm’s note; authepsa, i.e. a sels-acting cooking
