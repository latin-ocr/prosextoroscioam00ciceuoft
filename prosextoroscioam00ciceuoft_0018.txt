gonus bought it at the nominal price of 2000
sesterces²⁴ (2216 138. 4d.)‚ though the real value is

said to have been six million sesterces²⁶ (AE50‚000).
Three of the best estates were given 2⁶ to Capito as

his share of the spoil ; ²⁷ the ten remaining estates
and the personal effects were taken possession of

Since the purchases of a property had to undertake the debts
with which it was encumbered, Mommsen explains the word,
with great probability, in reference to the percentage which was
deducted from the price of a property, in consideration of its
being saddled with debts. Thus purchasers who, instead of the
full price, offered 50 per cent. of the price, would justly bc
called ‘ cutters off ' (sectores). The property of Milo, for
instance, on account of its indebtedness, was sold semuncia, i.e.
for ,ch of its value.

(ἐξ 21, 99, 108, 115, 117) he asserts it as a fact. We must,
however, suppose that Capito did not come into possession of
the three praedia immediately aster the sale: for, if sc, he could
hardly have appeared amongst the decem primi of Ameria in
Sulla's camp.
