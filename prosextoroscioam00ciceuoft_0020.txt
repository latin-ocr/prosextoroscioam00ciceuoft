The Amerini might make new efforts for their
unfortunate fellow-townsman; or, as time went
on, he might be reinstated through some political
movement.³⁶ Unless he were entirely got rid of,
they could not feel at ease.³⁷ Accordingly they
began to make plots against his life. Sextus, by
the advice of his friends5 fled to Rome,38 where he
found shelter and protection with Caecilia,3⁹ a noble
lady and a friend of his father : 4⁰ thus he was safe

⁴¹ It is remarkable that Cicero has not noticed the incon-
sistency involved in this plan of his opponents. If the elder
Roscius had really been proscribed, his murderer could not
legally be punished, for the lex Cornelia promised even rewards

slays his master, or the son who slays his father,’ Plut. Sulla, 31 ;

while if he had not been proscribed, the sale of his property
must have been illegal (Richter.)
