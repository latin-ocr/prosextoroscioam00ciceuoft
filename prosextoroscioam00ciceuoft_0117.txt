soi-Es, 85

P. 21. commisisse, absolute, ‘has beon guilty of a crime ; ’
unless aliquid has fallen out from confusion with aliquem, as
Hotoman conjectures: cp. ἓ 67.

in suspicione, and sine suspicione below, interpolated by
some commentator who wished to distinguish the different
occasions of latrare. On latratote see ξ 19, ίαάἱοαιοιε, note.

litteram illam, viz. K (see above on leqem Remmiam), which
letter was also an abbreviation for Kalendae, the day on which
interest was paid. [Cp. Hor. Sat. 1. 3. 87, cum misero tristes
venere Kalendae]

neminem; the calumniator besides being branded incurred
infamia, and could not act again as accuser.

fortunas suas accusare was said proverbially of those whc
suffered through their own fault. In the sense of ffmtunes,
‹lifgtrixngilgilze singular is more comm0n; cp. pro Sulla, §66,

c. xxr. §58. Here the digression on the accusatores ends.
With the question quid mihi, &c.‚ Cicero recalls the subject oi
c. xlx„ the contents of which are recapitulated in the form of
(ὂῖιενξαείο (opposed to perpetua oratio .· see on pro Sulla, §48).

ad detendendum, ‘as subject matter for my defence:’ [ad
suspicandum, ⁴ as ground for suspicion.']

audio, different from audio in §52; here in the sense ‘ I
hear you say s0‚ (but Ι want proofs.)’

nihil est, ⁴ there is no reason ; ’ [join with unde venerit, ⁴ from
which it may have occurred to you,' &a Nihil est is reiterated
in non . . . ηοη,· ‘. . . not a word as to whom he conferred
with, whom ho informed of his intention . . . ' ὅσα]

fraudem, i.e. the false accusation.

ὅ 59. [operae pretium erat, literally ‘it was worth while,
if you observed ς’ we should say, ‘ It would have been worth
your while to observe.']

credo, not ironically‚ but in jest; ‘ Ι cannot help thinking
that he must have inquired‚’ &c-

Quaesisse, without eum as subject; see Madvig, ξ 401, and
cp. ἐξ 61 venisse, 74 secisse, 97 audisse, 84 paratum esse, 100 pro-
diturum esse, 126 occisum esse. Halm notices the last three as
instances of the rare omission of the subject where there is a
separate predicate (paratam, proditurum, occisam).]

in hisce subselliis, as advocati of the accused: cp. ξ 12, note
on hic in soro.
