PREFAOE.

‘run Notes in this volume are for the most part
paraphrased from those of Professor Halm, with the·
kind permission of the Author, whose text (eighth
edition, Berlin 1877) has been followed throughout.
The notes within brackets have been drawn from
other sources, especially from Richter’s edition (re-
edited by Fleckeisen, 1877). The Introduction is
‘based on that of Halm, but it has been remodelled
and enlarged‚ and an analysis of the speech has been
added.

The Editor's best thanks are due to Mr. W. Warde

Fowler of Lincoln College‚ his friend and former

tutor, for much valuablc help and advice; also to
Mr. S. Bloxsidge, for various kind suggestions, and
for some quotations which have been added to the

notes in the Second Edition.
