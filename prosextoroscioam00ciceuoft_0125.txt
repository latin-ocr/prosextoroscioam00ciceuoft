norm. 93

[reiectus a ceteris suspicionibus. The last word seems to bo
used loosely; we should sey, ‘ways of rousing suspicion,’ or the
like. Cp. suspiciose dicere, ξ 55. in the same sense. Similarly
in Sall. Frag. ap. Non. 11. 900, multis suspicionibus volentia plebi
facturus videbatur, our word ‘suspicions' will hardly express
the Latin substantive; cp. above ὅ 28, in qua re nulla subesset
suspicio]

scopulum: see the first six lines of § 120.

P3 30, §80. vulgo, ‘stequently, as an every-day occur-
rence.

una mercede duas res adsequi. For other forms of the
proverb ep. ad Fam. vn. 29. 2, duo parietes de eadem fidelia (pot
of paint) dealbare,· [Plauti Oasin. 11. 8. 40, iam eqo uno in saltu
lepide apros capiam duos,· and the English equivalent. Una
mercede is abl. of price]

pervertere, ‘ to overthrow, ruin :' accusare autem eos ipsos,
Sto„ because, as Cicero proceeds to show, the arguments of
Erucius tell against his own side.

per quos et a quibus: cp. ξ97, quoniam cuius consilio occisus
sit invenio, cuius manu sit percussus non laboro.

nonne cogitas. [A question with nonne sometimes expresses,
not the conviction that a thing is, but surprise that it is not;
as if non stood in the place of norme. So nonne coqitas is not
‘Do you not think?’ but ‘Do you not-think, do you forget?’
Op. Tuso. 1. 17, ςῃυίἀ, si te rogavero aliquid, nonne respondebis.
·will you make no replyP’ de Finn. V. 86, norme iqitur tibi
tardentur, inquit, mala? ‘do you think they are not evils?'

at. 1. 1. 27.]

sectoribus, and below, sectores collorum et bonorum: see
Introd. note 23.

Quid postea 'l ‘ What then? What follows ‘?'

[nescisne per ista, διας i.e. ‘the sectores bonorum, such as
Chrysogonus, Magnus, and Capito, were usually also the sectores

collorum (cut-throats); so that if you talk of the multitude of
assassins‚ you accuse the very persons in whose pay you ποθ]

5 81. denique implies indignation.

ἓ 82. dissoluta est, the phrase for solving catch-questions
(Acad. pr. 11. 46, fallaces et captiosas interroqationes dissolvere),
also said, like the more common diluere, of the refutation of
charges which it required dialectical skill to subvert.

ὅ 3ggpglctatils ut, ‘ wait in the expectation that: ’ see Madvig,
