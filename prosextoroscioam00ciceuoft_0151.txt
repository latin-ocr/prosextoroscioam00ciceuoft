ausus est, sc. to set the accusation on foot.

valiturum, wanting in the best MSS: inferior ones have
posse. But as posse would here stand iu the sense ‘have power‚'
and not as the aux1hary verb ‘be able,' it would have to be·

inermis ; i.e. without myself joining in the combat.

P. 53. so ipsum probe novit; i.e. he understands that he

laeditur . . . separatur, ‘is injured, in that he is shut out
from this glorious cause: ’ [i.e. invectives which, as Cicero's‚
deny any connection between Chrysogonus and the party of
the nobles, deny it equally of any man who is the fautor of
Chrysogonus.]

ξ 129 onwards: cp. extrema oratio, ξ 129].

consequences from Cicero’s boldness.

imperitus morum, ‘ with no knowledge of the world, igno-
rant of life : ’ in this sense rerum imperitus (iqnaras, nescius,
