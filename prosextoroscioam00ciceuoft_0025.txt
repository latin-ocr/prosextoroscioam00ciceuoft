true that in several places the style is youthfully
overladen and st1·ained;⁰³ the periods are not so
rounded and full, nor the transitions so natural
and unaffected‚ as in his later works; there are
'many peculiarities in the diction which are not
to be found in the later speecheS‚ though some of
them are certainly due to incorrect transmission.
But these individual defects are amply compensated
for by the good impression which the speech makes
as a whole. It shows young Cicero still in the
garb of innocence ; the deep conviction of the justice
of his cause exalts and animates him as he speaks;
none of his statements represent him as serving the
interest of one party, or merely playing the advo·
cate: in the consciousness of right he utterly forgets
the powerful faction which stands opposed to him
with scoffs and threats. And we should admire, no
loss than the manly boldness with which he faccs
his abandoned opponents, the moderation and
prudence with which he avoids everything that can
offend the all-powerful dictator. The moral indig-
nation which speaks from every line of the speech,
must have made all the deeper impression upon his
hearers in the forum, the longer the voice of justice

⁰³ Cic. Orat. 107: quantis illa clamoribus (applause) adules-
centuli diximus de supplicio parricidarum! quae nequaquam
satis deferbuisse post aliquanto sentire coepimus.- ‘quid enim
tam commune quam spiritus vivis . . . ut ue ad saxa quidem
mortui conquiescant ’ (c. XXVI. §72)-et quae sequuntur ,· sunt
enim omnia sicut adulescentis mm tam re et maturitate quam spe
et exspectatione laudati.
