by- Ulysses when the 'Greeks were driven back to their ships by
Hector* and their bravest heroes killed.

curtios, Marios ς of these nothing further is known. [Richter
suggests for the latter name M. Marius Gratidianus a connec-
tion of Cicero through his grandmother Gratidia, styled aptio-
simue turbulentis concionibus, Brut. 233, who at Sulla's command
was murdered by Catilina]

Mammeos, a corrupt reading: Ursinus suggests Memmt’os
from Brut. 136, where the brothers O. and L. Memmii are
described as oratores mediocres, accusatores acres atque acerbi ,-
[but only one of these lived till Sulla's supoemacy, for the elder
Gaius had been murdered by the gangs of Saturninus and
,Glaucia, ΒΩ. 100.]

[a proeliis, sc. forensibus] avocabat.- so that they were no
longer to be feared as combatants in the legal ἀγῶνες, and need
not have been put to death. There is an allusion in aetas
avocabat to the exemption of seniores or men between 45 and
60 years of age from military service in the field.

Priamum ipsum, a mock-heroic title for the eldest or chief
of the accusem. [Cicero should have chosen a Greek name
rather than a Trojan, after ferro Phryqio above; but Priam's
name was a perpetuum ἐπίθετον apud trayicos Latinos, Orelli]
{ome take Priamum ipsum senem as a second quotation from

nmus.

Antistium cannot be identified. Some understand P. Antis-
tius, rabula sane probabilis [‘a likely follow enough as a stump
orator ’]‚ whom we hear of in Brut. 226. But Cicero there names
him as one of the patroni of the time, not as an accusator5 and
he fell, not in the Sullan proscriptione here alluded to, but
previously under the younger Marius, as a partisan of Sulla,
82 13.o.: cp. Mommsen, 111. 336. Also the words etiam leqes
puqnare prohibebant do not suit this Antistius, as they point to
an accuser who had suffered the penalties of infamia (see ὅ 55),
and hence could not again act as accusem while P. Antistius
appears to have acted as an orator shortly before his death.
[We hear in pro Balb. ξ 48, of a L. Antistius, disertus hom, who
in no. 95 accusled T. Matrinius of Spoletum for false assumption
of civic rights, ’

inter sicarios, Introd. note 75. Accusers who were wont to

attack such crimes, were those most likely to be feared and
siaiu by Sulla's assassins.
