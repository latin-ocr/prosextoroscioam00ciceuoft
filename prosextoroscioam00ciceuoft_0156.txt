he kept his other son (since dead) with him in Rome. But
such treatment, so far from proving enmity, was a mark of
honour, and the post was lucrative. 55 45, 46. Nor can you
argue that the father preferred the other son to Sextus; the
similar case in Caecilius’ play shows the opposite. 55 47, 48.
I mention the case in the play rather than allude to living
persons; but 1 could name many fathers who make favourite
sons work at agriculture; and we all know many men who look
on a rustic life as both pleasant and honourable. 5 49. Sextus
himself was a zealous and skilful farmer; though now, alas!
he has no further need for his skill. 55 50, 51. Our ancestors

hearing to prove ill-will between father and son—⁶ The father
intended to disinherit him.' 55 53, 54. Ι pass over your not
explaining why the father should have intended such a harsh act,
and merely ask you to prove that he did intend it. You have
not a word to say in proof. This is sheer mockery of the

which may have led Sextus to commit the crime. But so grave
a charge as one of parricide ought to have every species of evi-

the slightest defect in the evidence is enough to quash a charge
