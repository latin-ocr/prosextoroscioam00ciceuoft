qui vester animus sit, ‘ your real disposition,' the free mani-
festation ol which would put a check on deeds of violence.

prorumpere (for which proruptura esse or prorumpere posse
would be expected)=‘is on the way to break forth.¹ The
construction is irregular, and so rare as to render the reading
doubtful. [The pres. may be rhetorical: ‘is even now breaking

Brutus conservatas erit, vicimus, where the pe . instead of the

[hio in foro. ‘ The Praetor had his seat (sella curulis) on a
raised piatform (tribunal), under the open air, in the forum; the

intelleyere possitis above, and the position of et rei publicae

c. v1. ξ 15. [municeps, a citizen of a municipium, which term

at this date meant a town govcmed by its own magistrates, and

sessing the full rights of Roman citizenship ; the latter having

een granted to all Italian towns during the Social War by the
lex Iulia, Rc. 90, and the lex Plautia Papiria, ao. 89.]

hospitiis florens . . . nobilissimorum. Note the emphasis
falling on the last word; it enhances the shamefulness of
inscribing a friend of Sulla's own party on the proscription list.
