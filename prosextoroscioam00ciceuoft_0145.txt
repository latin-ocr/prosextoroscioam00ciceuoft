wqttlld also have expected an adversative particle below, at Dixi

P. 46. dixi initio, ξ 83.

pessunt: see ξ 91, note.

diligenter, ‘ accurately‚' i.e. proving everything in detail.

quibus: the antecedent is ea quae, not suspicionibus. De
quibus . . . disserendum sit = which are such that I must speak
of them at greater length.

ingeniis coniecturaeque: see ἓ 8, note on per sententias.

c.X1.111.§124. nomen aureum chrysogoni, periphrasis for ad
Chrysoqonum. In auream there is an allusion not only to the
name, but also to the wealth amassed by Chrysogonus through
the proscriptionS. (Chrysoqoni has been marked as a gloss ; an
obvious conjecture, though it is a question whether the allu-
sion would have been clear enough to Roman hearers and
readers without the addition of the name.)

sub quo nomine = sub cuius nomine, as in Verr. 11. 5. 177,
quam (leqem) non is promulqavit, quo nomine rescriptam videti85
so eo nomine freq. = eius rei nomine: see 93, in eo num-ero,
note.

latuit: see ξ 21, manceps fit Chrys-cycnus.
nihil attinet3 i.e. which I care nothing for.

in comunem causam sectorum; i.e. I have no wish to attack
the sectores as a body.

ἓ 125. qua ratione, ‘ on what principle : ' cp. §96.

si . . . audientur, διο. The meaning seems to be this:
Cicero is discussing the, purchase merely as illeqal because the
late owner had not been proscribed, not as unyust because he
was an inoffensive mam and he says, If complaints of this kind
(viz. hominis innocentis bona veniisse) shall ever (in happier
times) be freely discussed and listened to, there will be more
distinguished men than Sex. Roscius to complain about. The
correctness of the passage is very doubtful. One would ex-
pect aeque libenter audientur ac libere dicentur, ‘ shall be heard
as willingly as they are spoken voluntarily.'

P. 47. sive Valeria est sive cornelia: see Introd. note 21.

verum: see Zumpt, §739. The words qui potuerunt ista
ipsa leqe are repeated in a different order: an instance of the

figure conduplicata for which see Auct. ad Her. 1v.. c. 285
Verr. 11. 5. 107, Halm's note.
