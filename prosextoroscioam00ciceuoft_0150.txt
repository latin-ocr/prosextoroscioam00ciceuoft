[P. 52. ne ominis quidem causa3 ne reiterates nolo, as it
does nihil in §38 ‘I am unwilling-on the mere ground of
its being a bad omen Ι am unwilling—to say anything too
severe against them.' The mere mention of a thing was looked
on as a possible omen of its happening; cp. PhiL 1v. 10, quibus

opposed to Sulla, who afterwards took terriblo revenge.

in Plautus; [it is used again by Cicero, de Lege Agr. 1. 5].
