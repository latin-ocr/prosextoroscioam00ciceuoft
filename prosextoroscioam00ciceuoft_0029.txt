inter sicarios. This phrase needs a shoit explana-
tion.⁷⁴

In early times, oriminal cases in Rome used to
come before the whole people, assembled in the
Comitia centuriata and tributa. But, owing to the
inconvenienoe of this mode of trial, the Comitia
frequently used to delegate their power to special
commissions‚ quaestiones, of one or more persons,
appointed to try individual cases. The next step
was to establish, instead of these temporary eom-
missions, permanent commissions or oourts (quaes-
tiones perpetuae), which sat to try the oommoner
crimes: the first instance of this was the standing
commission to try cases of extortion (de pecuniis
repetundis), established in 149 B.C.‚ on the proposal
of L. Calpurnius Piso. The system grew, and was
finally brought into general operation by Sulla,
who much inoreased the number of the permanent
courts. anh quaestio dealt with one class of
offences only: thus there was a quaestio de repe-
tundis, another de peculatu, another de ambitu, another
inter sicarios,⁷⁵ and so forth3 the last-named being

⁷⁵ The expression quaestio, iudicium inter sicarios (ξ 11), as·
well as inter sicarios deferre, accusare (ξ 90), defendere, was
used, because there was no substantive to express the action of
murder, answering to peculatus, veneficium, &Q ; it was impos-
sible ω say sicae deser-re, on the analogy ot· veneficii deferre, or
de sica deferre, on that of de vi deferre. It was therefore said,
ita deferre ut nomen alicuius imer sicarios referatur ,· instead of
which the short phrase inter sicarios deferre and the· other

analogous forms came into use.
