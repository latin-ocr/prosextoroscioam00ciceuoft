invaserit, ironically for invasit, implying that Chrysogonus
himself gave that reason for the request. [⁵ Since, as he says, he
has seized upon‚' &a Op. quod adeptus est, below, indicat]

[obstare atquo officere, i.e. bars his way to it, hinders his en-
joyment of it. The same words are in ἓξ 112,145. Cp„ on the
