principle could he purchase the property of Sex. Roscius, who
was never proscribed, and was a partisan of Sulla? ξ 127.
Chrysogonus effected the confiscation and sale of the property
—if ever there was a sale—by misrepresenting the deceased’s
character. ἓξ 128, 129. If the sale ever took place, it was
illegal, as the proper period had expired. Ι mention this, not
because Sextus now regrets the loss of his property, but as a
matter of common concern. ἐξ 130, 131. Ι demand,then, an
