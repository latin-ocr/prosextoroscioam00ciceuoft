favourite of the dictator Sulla, who was with Sulla
in his camp at Volaterrae.¹⁴

2. It was now but a few months after the Sullan
reign of terror and the Proscription. Sulla had
doomed to death all who had publioly taken part
against him in Italy, and all such persons were
proscribed3 isse. a formal list of their names was
made out and published. Now, since the property
of the proscribed was confiscated by Sulla to reward
his agents, those who coveted the possessions of others
had but to contrive to have their names placed on
the proscription list: thus many innocent persons
fell victims merely to avarice or to private enmity.
‘ The slaughter did not cease,’ says Sallust, ‘ until
Sulla had enriched all his followers.’ 1⁵ In this

way Chrysogonus had already acquired immense

¹⁴ Volaterrae was one of the last towns which (aster a twc
years’ siege, nc. 80) surrendered to Sulla. Cp. Strabo, v. 2. 6:
‘ There some of the Etruscans and those who were proscribet]
by Sulla assembled3 they formed four cohorts of an army,
were besieged for two years, and then surrendered the place
under a truce.⁹

²⁵ Sall. Cat. 51. 32: nostra memoria victor Sulla oum
Damasippum et alios eius modi, qui malo rei publicae creverant,
iuqulari iussit, quis non sactum eius laudabat? homines scelestos
et factiosos, qui seditionibus rem publicam exagitaverant, merito
necatos aiebant. Sed ea res ‘maynae initium cladis suit .· nam
uti quisque domum aut villam, postremo ‘cas aut vestimentum
alicuius concupiverat, dabat operam ut is in proscriptorum

numero esset . . . neque prius finis iuqulandi suit, quam Sulla
omnes suos divitiis explet-it.
