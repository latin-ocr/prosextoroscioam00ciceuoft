so that his entire property fell in to the State.²2 It
was then sold by public auction 32³ and as no one

made to assume this law out of the lex Valeria passed on the
motion of L. Valerius Flaccus, Interrex Β.σ. 82; because the
latter laW, which was passed in the Comitia centuriata, and
conferred the dictatorship on Sulla (Momms. 111. 348), contained
also the provision (Cic. de Lege Agr. 111. 5) ut omnia quae-
cumque ille fecisset essent rata. Cp. Cic. de Legg. 1. 42: si
triqinta illi Athenis 16968 imponere voluissent, ant si omnes
Athenienses delectarentur tyrannicis leqibus, num idcirco eae
leqes iustae haberentur ἲ Nihilo, crede, maqis illa, quam interrex
noster tulit, ut dictator quem vellet civium impune posset occidere.
Thus we can understand why Cicero uses the vagus phrase
(ξ 125) sive Valeria est sive Cornelia, and professes to know the
contents of the lex only from hearsay (ξ 126, scriptum enim ita
dicunt esse; and ξ 128, opinor enim esse in leqe): it was, in fact,
not a lex, but a scriptio privata, with which a member of the
republican party did not need to be acquainted.

enemies, whose property used from the earliest times to be con-
fiscated.

²³ -The property of a proscribed person was sold as public
property sub hasta (originally the symbol of booty won in battle,
and set up in the camp when it was sold), i.e. by public
auction, and was always sold as an undivided whole. Such a
sale was called sectio; the purchaser, sector .· cp. Gaius, Inst. IV.
146, sectores vocantur qui publica bona mercantur. The meaning
of the word sector is very obscure, and was so even to the
ancient grammarians, who derived it from sequi, sectari, and
explained sectores as = sectatores bonorum. The derivation
from secare (ξ 80, sectores bonorum et collorum) seems more
correct ; but the theory that the purchasers were called sectores
because they used to ‘ cut up ' the entire property which they
had bought into small divisione so as to sell it again, is surely
a false one. (It is expressly contradicted by§ 103: testimoninm
